imaginary or complex mathematical object:
. set
. unit
. rotation
. line
. non-real

all comments below:
. i = srqt(-1) which cannot happen in typical symbol manipulation
. the effect of i * i yields a real point between (-inf, +inf)
. doing arithmatic is possible if rotation and scaling is allowed
. a + b*i is stereotypical complex number with part living in pure reality
. part living in imagination is tethered to some component in the reals
. the effect of b on the b*i segment could yield a real value back
. expression of complex type is composable with other expression of the same type
. a + b*i multiplied with a copy of itself will yield a*a + b*i * b*i which brings b*b to the opposite side at equal distance from the center
. i will create a proof showing computationally that any expression like above could be realized using real expression inside a sphere.

the proof object:
. shall use spheres that interact
. rotations are unproblematic
. more later!
