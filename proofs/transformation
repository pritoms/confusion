considering spherical objects:
. there is a volume defined on interior
. volume contains many points
. points outside the volume is projected
. every point is adderessible
. addressing requires transforming cartesian
. transformation yields valid spherical coordinate
. center of the object is crucial
. identity is attached to the origin


questions and unsharpness:
. difference between n spheres
. dimensional suppression?
. every sphere can have volume
. role of origin to that spherical object
. description of a particular sphere
. state of spherical object?
. allowed operations applicable to spheres


resolutions and clarifications:
. some of them can have circles, balls, embedding
. higher dimensional spheres embedded inside lower dimensional spheres
. spheres only have surface are as measurable properties but balls could have volume
. critial; sphere is defined as set of points constant distance away from origin
. dimensionality, radius, center of embedding, parameters -- intrinsic such as curvature, metric tensor or extrinsically such as embedded properties in dimension larger than it
. geometry, orientation, field values, phase state - minimal set of values used to determine behavior or identity


development on the basis:
. instead of taking about
