!! all comments below:
. i shall talk in max of two lines about these:
.. peaks and valleys in a cycle:
.. . these are levels where truth exists simultaneously
.. . what is true at a maxima is only true because of what is true or false at minima
.. reversibility and conservation
.. . because there is a relative high/low, there is also a relative near/far referring to the max/min
.. . global reversibility can govern local inconsistency to the limit of sampling resolution
.. circuit construction and locality
.. . each countably many node can processed to create countably many antinodes by locally defined operators acting unitarily over finite region
.. . locality is defined by the continuous evolution of all channels where the local operations create antinodes that remain within the windowed region
