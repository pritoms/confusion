**types of moments**
1. serial
2. parallel

***serial***
1.1 direction of change
1.2 change happens at unit speed
1.3 unit change in direction yield transformed unit backward to adjacent unit
1.4 sequentially evaluated and passed along to preceding member
1.5 A -> B with unit distance seperating B from A where B' is experienced by A to become A'. if C followed from B then C' would go into causing B' which then causes A' and A' marks the end of computation.
1.6 all components (A, B, C, ..) must share the same environment throughout the execution path

***parallel***
2.1 depth in change
2.2 change happens at same moment
2.3 unit change happens everywhere at the same moment which is different than moment in time -- it is better to say that change happens at the same point in time where serial process requires different points in time
2.4 independently evaluated and combined together at same point
2.5 A + B + C with level seperation changes each of (A, B, C) independently inside their own environments at the same instance in time and the results are combined together to produce Ã† which contains all the information
2.6 all channels (A, B, C) must not share the same environment for doing their computation throughout anywhere in the execution path but rather only the net effect can be brought together under the same environment description
